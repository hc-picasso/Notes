Good day Ramón

Do you think we can use a power of attorney as the legal designation?

We have a one pager of HC's purpose mission and vision, would that be usefu for purpose statement?


As following is how HC envisions publications:

1. Dataset (on data repositories if possible, see below)
    - Initial Carbon distribution characterization data (~ 15 plants)
    - Inventory Data (Includes carbon and dm, allometric dimensions)
    - Geospatial data (polygon)
    - Drone Raw imagery or if not possible, georeferenced 'low quality' tiled raster file if relevant.
2. Deliverables as stated in the technical annex (others from the dataset) from technical annex as research artefacts (HC would like them to be open. See notes below).
    - If relevant and possible as Jupyter notebook
    - Includes code, repository on github 
3. Instructional technical document (Guía Técnica?) for Drone & GIS technicians/service providers to be able to replicate the deliverables for other sites.
4. Flyer (Folleto técnico) for Drone & GIS technicians/service providers to know that this exists.
5. Flyer (Folleto para productores) for farmers to know this system exists. 
6. Scientific publication in journal.

HC would like all publications to be open access, published under open access licences as soon as they are delivered according to the chronogram and you are comfortable they are completed, whithout rushing anything. We'd like them to be published soon because we need to:

    - Show data, code, error calculation process to registries and potential buyers
    - Embed data/images in website
    - Embed methodology (directed to the general public so they have a general idea of how t works)
        
Please let us know your thoughts on the proposed publication timelines and conditions for the 1st and 2nd publications. My understanding last meeting was that it would be better to keep the data for some time before publishing it for the best outcome of Publication 3 and/or 6 -Please correct me if I'm wrong-. I think it would be good for us to talk more about this in a forecoming meeting. 


Regarding the seventh clause, we'd like to ask more specificly how would IP right-holding be at the end of the day for the publications (i.e. patrimonial rights) and the other forms of IP mentioned therein.

Regarding the payments, If a Mexican entity were to provide such payments, would there be an increase because of taxes? or would it be the same amount of money?

Thank you Ramón, looking forward for your feedback.

### Zenodo
https://about.zenodo.org/

"Don't wait until the publication date!

Publication may happen months or years after completion of the research, so collecting together all the research artefacts at that stage to publish openly is often challenging. Zenodo therefore offers the possibility to house closed and restricted content, so that artefacts can be captured and stored safely whilst the research is ongoing, such that nothing is missing when they are openly shared later in the research workflow.

Additionally, to help publishing, research materials for the review process can be safely uploaded to Zenodo in restricted records and then protected links can be shared with the reviewers. Content can also be embargoed and automatically opened when the associated paper is published.

To support all these use cases, the simple web interface is supplemented by a rich API which allows third ­party tools and services to use Zenodo as a backend in their workflow "
