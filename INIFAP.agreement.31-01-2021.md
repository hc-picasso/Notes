Ramón sent answer back from questions along with the new technical proposal.

Q: Do you think we can use a power of attorney as the legal designation?

A: Only if it is explicit in the document.

Q: We have a one pager of HC's purpose mission and vision, would that be useful for purpose statement?}

A: Yes, please give me the address.

Q: As following is how HC envisions publications:
Please let us know your thoughts on the proposed publication timelines and conditions for the 1st and 2nd publications. My understanding last meeting was that it would be better to keep the data for some time before publishing it for the best outcome of Publication 3 and/or 6 -Please correct me if I'm wrong-. I think it would be good for us to talk more about this in a forthcoming meeting. 

A: Please, include state this into the body of the agreement. Once the department of legislation of INIFAP check it, you will know if it is possible or not. As a technical part, I can see this is feasible, but let see if they also think it is possible.

Q: Regarding the seventh clause, we'd like to ask more specifically how would IP right-holding be at the end of the day for the publications (i.e. patrimonial rights) and the other forms of IP mentioned therein.

A: It is very similar to the previous question, because it is a project paid by you and implemented by us. Together, we can propose how the results of this project will be used, what is your proposal? Please include it in this section, and based on that proposal, let's build a joint proposal.

Q: Regarding the payments, if a Mexican entity were to provide such payments, would there be an increase because of taxes? or would it be the same amount of money?

A: There are two types of projects to be carried out by INIFAP, Research and Service. This is a Research project and there will be no TAX cost, I have just been informed. It does not matter if it is a Mexican or Foreign entity.
