Appendix b modification

Minimum dbh at 1 inch, rationale for it:
Negative carbon for early years of forest due to decomposition. Richard Hall would leave it at 4 1/2 inches.

Jeremy Klass:

Slim trees are excluded because those are the ones they are tying to thin or would burn down. From a management perpective there should be a threshold.

Brian: CR and Verra allow quantification beginning at 1-inch.  Those are ARR standards

Measurement plant should state minimum dbh and stick to it, min permissible is 1 inch.

Prescribed fire? Offset that? Offset catastrophic fire?

Steve Graham:
Does it have the same carbon value where prescribed fire is used vs those where it isn't?
As well as harvested vs not harvested.

David Valerio:
Market differentiation according to management. Haven't gone into details with that.

James Blackburn:

Grassland: no credit for aboveground so no adjustment there.
If certain piece of the forest like understory, is not credited, then, is the same case as grasslands. So that would apply to slim trees to be thinned. Or work it out from thinning percentage from plan. If burned and previously credited the should be discounted from account.

Brian: it's either going to be there or not going to be there

## Number and location of permanent plots

Analogous to the soil sampling, 

### What's best randomly or systematically?

Systematic would askew results. RShould be as random as possible.

Richard: 
For commercially managed more common is systematic
He would leave it open to both

Jeremy: 
Are plantations planed on a systematic manner, are there discrete age classes? Couldn't a plantation manger focus on older plantations ?

Richard:
Should be worked out in the stratification process and if choose not to, should systematically cover the whole thing to prevent cherry picking.

There are practical considerations to systematic. 

Jeremy: Make sure there are check and balances for correct stratification and prevent cherry picking.

## Size of permanent plots
Richard:
leave open

Minimum statistical threshold, as long as it meets it, it's appropriate.

Jeremy:
Facilitating: References for inventory best practices by state

### Number of permanent plots

90% confidence interval is good

### Procedure for timber cruises

David:
He would no include specific references.
Jeremy:
But access to specific practices

David: Prescriptive on what people should be measuring for forest vegetation simulator

What variables to collect and how to input them in the simulator.

### Calculation content using FVS

KCain: 
What about validation of remote sensing?

Richard:
Remote sensing is not there yet, hope it can soon produce results with enough statistical soundness

Jeremy: LiDAR-> Allometric


### Finishing thoughts

Jeremy: Carbon from plantations vs diverse forests.

David: Time based proposal HC, put into the agenda future.

David: traceability of wood after tree cut down
