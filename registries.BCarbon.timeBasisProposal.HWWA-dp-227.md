# Summary

**Hamburg Institute of International Economics Discussion Paper 227**

The positions of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), summarized in the Partiesâ€™ submissions and a subsequent options paper by the Secretariat (UNFCCC 2002c), agree largely that certified emission reductions (CERs) from AR projects should reflect the temporary nature of carbon storage and therefore have a limited validity.

In 2000, the delegation of Colombia proposed a scheme under which CERs are only granted temporarily and would need to be fully compensated upon their expiration.  
Though modified and revised by several Parties, this approach has successfully been established in the international discussion.  
The reason is that it is simple to understand and bookkeeping is manageable for national and international registries.  
After expiration of the temporary credits, the buyer is held liable to replace them, while there is no buyer liability during the validity period of the tCERs.  
If after expiration the forest is still in place, the tCERs from the same AR project can be re-issued.  
Obviously, the contract between investor and host partners can cover several credit validity periods.  
Any solution along these lines is a likely outcome of the negotiations, even though methodological details around accounting, credit duration, and the maximum frequency of re-issuance are still to be resolved.  
TCERs will be a new type of carbon credit, which is not directly fungible with any other emission permits, AAUs, ERUs, RMUs and CERs.  
While other emission permits offset greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions once and forever, tCERs only allow for a break in liability for emissions.  
According to a proposal made by the EU, this break is fixed to the length of one commitment period. The effect of the break is that in the second commitment period the liability for emissions compensated through tCERs used in the first commitment period will arise anew.  
This means that any private-sector entity investing in CDM sinks projects would have to bear the full liability for non-permanent projects. We further assume that the tCER validity period would be five years and would be synchronous with the Kyoto commitment periods.

Finally, the fact that tCERs are not fungible with other emission permits raises at least three questions:
1. What will be the consequences for the project developer on the tCER  production side?
2. What will be the price level of tCERs in relation to that of permanent permits?
3. Who will buy credits that only offset excess emissions for a limited period?
