Here, we describe four promising approaches for successful and cost-effective semi-arid and arid land restoration: strip seeding, fertile island seeding, rock/brush piles and seedballs. 
Strip seeding is particularly well suited for semi-arid environments (Shaw et al. 2020) and involves seeding species in strips
Preliminary work (JS unpublished research) suggests that five years after project initiation, target areas that were seeded at rates as low as 33% cover using strip seeding result in a density of restoration species that is comparable to areas that were seeded at 100% cover 
Strip seeding has the proposed benefits of reducing seed cost (less area seeded), increasing diversity (through an increase in spatial and structural heterogeneity of plants), and increasing logistical feasibility of project deployment (less labor required to seed an area) compared to conventional approaches.
However, this planting method can take longer than traditional active restoration methods to achieve the same outcomes, particularly in terms of total plant cover.
This might be a particular challenge for industrial projects where regulations often require a specific percentage of cover over a fixed number of years
