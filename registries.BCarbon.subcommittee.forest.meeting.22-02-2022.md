How to implement principle 12?

10 Yr time could represent some troubles

No criteria for soil function, nor diversity, rely on categorization. Actively development of different tiers which would take into account this differences.

Ted: Would monoculture, monocrop, single age would be a potential liability in terms of potential susceptibility to pests and disease.

By having a forest standard can appeal small owners, prevent conversion to grassland.

Criteria for categories i.e. strata, diversity.
Potential integration of prescribed burns as management strategy to remove understory combustible brush.

Proposing creation of new 'harvested wood protocol'
Proposing 'Natural forest protocol' prescribing certain amounts of tree species, diversity, age, classes to qualify for "Bcarbon Natural Forest Credits"
Both rely on current general protocol

Night crawlers destroying forest in some places.

Concern about invasive species. like mesquite.

Spending tons of money to remove mesquite with bulldozers and so on.
Would it be more viable to pay to manage a mesquite ecosystem?

Consider effects of climate change on management and potential species distribution.

Other important parameters for a natural forest that are often missing from intensely managed forestlands include standing dead and down timber, embedded wetlands, understory diversity (herbaceous and woody).
