### Points to clarify:  

1. Facts:
    - Data from unpruned plants, due to the 4 plants per sp. and age group (assumed (not verified), as there it was said by local guide). (dataset)
    - Data from carbon was taken from 2 plants in the rainy season
    - Nutritional management has not been well defined yet
    - Pest and disease management has not been well defined yet
    

1. Estimations (no data yet):
    - Dense plantings will affect growth rate/ biomass accrual
    - Dense plantings will make management and harvesting more difficult if not impossible
    - Dense plantings will make many plants go to quiote before 12 years (americana, salmiana salmiana, mapisaga, atrovirens mirabilis, weberi)
    - Well drained soil is needed for expected growth rates (loam-sandy)

1. We are assuming:

    - Plant's age (biomass dataset)

    - 20% penca harvesting from year 4
            -  Perfect regrowth of that 20%
    - Planting density won't affect growth rate/quiote age
    - Planting density won't affect maintenance labor/viability
    - No plant losses
    - Uniform growth
    - Negligeble pest/disease pressure
    
 Present arenal & Zamarriapa photos

 Present Riker Model  

Point out main variable of model

- Acreage
- Planting density
- Wage per Joral
- Rastrojo paca
- %DM %C
- $USD/Ton CO2e
- Credit emissiom
- Marketplace Fee
- Water
- Tools/Inputs


**Numbers seem negative for the mantnance period before piña harvest, seems like 50 ¢ MXN per kg pf fresh penca ex works do not seem to cut it **

Need to review the cost of nutritional, pest and disesase management.
