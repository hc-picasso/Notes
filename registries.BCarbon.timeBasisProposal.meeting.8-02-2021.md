Jim questioned the viability of using the forest methodology given the lifecycle of the plant.

We presented an example of inadequate staggering which exaggerates aboveground biomass variability.

Jim was off the meeting by then, but will be shared afterwards  with all people present in the meeting.

Had discussion about ton year concept

FYI - The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) provides a ton-year accounting option in some of its published protocols, including its Soil Enrichment Protocol. CAR’s ton-year method asserts that 1 tCO₂ stored for 100 years is equivalent to 1 tCO₂ emitted. For projects that do not want to commit to CAR’s standard 100-year permanence obligation, CAR gives 1/100th of a credit for each year 1 tCO₂ is stored. (CAR’s calculation of partial credit is distinct from any other published ton-year approach that we’ve come across; it relies on the assumption that 100-years is “permanent” and gives partial credit for anything less.)
