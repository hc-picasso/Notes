## This note describes how Hudson Carbon envisions publications from INIFAP

---

1. Dataset (on data repositories if possible, see below)
    - Initial Carbon distribution characterization data (~ 15 plants)
    - Inventory Data (Includes carbon and dm, allometric dimensions)
    - Geospatial data (polygon)
    - Drone Raw imagery or if not possible, georeferenced 'low quality' tiled raster file.
2. Deliverables (others from the dataset) from technical annex as research artefacts (Can they be open? See notes below).
    - If relevant and possible as Jupyter notebook
    - Includes code, repository on github 
3. Instructional technical document (Guía Técnica?) for Drone & GIS technicians/service providers to be able to replicate the deliverables for other sites.
4. Flyer (Folleto técnico) for Drone & GIS technicians/service providers to know that this exists.
4. Flyer (Folleto para productores) for farmers to know this system exists. 
5. Scientific publication in journal or elsewhere.

- HC would like all publications to be open access, published as soon as they are delivered according to the gant chart.

- If INIFAP would prefer to save the data for some months, we would need some restricted licences to show to potential registries and clients, but not too many months. Need to talk about it.



## Dataset & research artifact repository options
### Zenodo
https://about.zenodo.org/

"Don't wait until the publication date!

Publication may happen months or years after completion of the research, so collecting together all the research artefacts at that stage to publish openly is often challenging. Zenodo therefore offers the possibility to house closed and restricted content, so that artefacts can be captured and stored safely whilst the research is ongoing, such that nothing is missing when they are openly shared later in the research workflow.

Additionally, to help publishing, research materials for the review process can be safely uploaded to Zenodo in restricted records and then protected links can be shared with the reviewers. Content can also be embargoed and automatically opened when the associated paper is published.

To support all these use cases, the simple web interface is supplemented by a rich API which allows third ­party tools and services to use Zenodo as a backend in their workflow "
