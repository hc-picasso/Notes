- Draft of protocol for measurement aboveground biomass is presented 
- Diferentiation of BCarbon is promoting env services focus but would allow large monoculture projects
- **Different tiers of credits for different management strategies (more expensive tier with those focused on env serv)**
- WHat's the overarching goal? to provide a nature based climate solution by creating natural systems that reduce carbon in the atmosphere. 
    - BCarbon standard has lower threshold additionality and permanence
    - Having less ecological valio is not equal to no ecological value
    - Acknowledge lower price of carbon credits due to lower add perm thresholds
    - 10 year time criteria would allow other market players to come in after 20 yrs, then harvest and count the carbon in the wood as carbon residual.
    - "Benefits of clear cutting": poplar were mentioned as the succesional boost
    
Miguel:
> MAybe for a BCarbon forestry credit, the credit has to be retired during the life of the contract? used and retired

Mike: 
>To be clear as it’s written, the BCarbon crediting system will include larger monoculture plantations even if they do not plan to change management practices? But if they do improve forestry management they could receive a higher carbon credit price?
BCarbon: 
>Agree let's think more about that

Mike:
>I don’t see how crediting existing forestry managements (with no plan of forestry improvement) will have a net CO2 reduction in the atmosphere  

Brian Thomas:
>This discussion goes directly to a la carte approach stacked benefits.  Pros: 1.) pricing signal for various BCarbon offerings 2) Incentivize owners/developers to best "tier" for their region/practices 3) Market-based effects for higher value credits flow more investment to that "Eco lift" .  Starts virtuous investment cycle

- Metrics sub comitee gont an email with different tiers of crdits

- % of clear cuttable surface allowed -> according to plans

- Stratification - minimum standards as long as statistics are good enough
- How to certify propietary algorithms?
- Forest Vegetation simulator as the mail primary tool, set formulas and parameters and then it's relatively standarized

- **Third party verifiers? Not defined yet**

- BCarbon has in house veifier like Verra, don't have third party yet. Exploring how to implement 3rd parties (certification, etc.)

- Any polygon can only be in a single BCarbon protocol at the same time.

- Aditionaity definition and appliction in forest domain. Will develop official position in the following weeks on a separate call. 

- Management Plans and Vegetation simulator as basic requirements how are they going to be addresed for non US countries

## Internal Discussion

Mike:

> Industrial tree plantations would get money for doing noothing, BCarbon would be critisized.

> Be clear with David about this concern about getting paid in Business as usual (Confirm with Ben) Don't want to be part of an organization with bad rep. Some kind of better practices is needed.
