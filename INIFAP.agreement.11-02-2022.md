Could we alter the agreement to make this technical annex shareable with confidentiality restrictions?

- Change it in the general agreement

Polygon not definitive, will probably change with information we get while being there
- Not a problem, as long as we define the general site area. He can change the image without the polygon.

Could you list all the allometric sources which are to be used? (we talked about 3 per species) This would help us when describing this research before publications.

- He will list all variables in this proposal.

Only volume estimation? Not measuring?

- Check if it is written if volume is measured with xilomer

We would propose size groups instead of age groups

3 size groups

- Will change to size 

//Will look to include definition of species in the technical proposal

How would cogollo pencas would be selected?

- The outermost penca, the softest innermost penca, an the one in between.

We would like to discuss possibility of taking slices instead of cubes and more subsamples per piña

- Slice and corer pressler were mentioned, if cutting in 4 parts


Why two lab options?

CEBAJ is closer, but it's more expensive. Unknown sample processing?

Cost for OM lap processing is $150 mxn per sample

- Maybe make a comparison for 3 plants between Cristo's method and dumas
- Archive of samples to go back if needed probably with HC new york equipment

- Proposed method is different fromCristo's method, Ramon will send NOM

- 12 samples of piña per plant well understood

- Freezer for all the samples

Continuation 15 Feb

- Cleared out the calcination is not the NOM for soil. Ramon will send technical data on it.

- Ramón will look for more exact cost of LECO. Cristo responded; Calcination $50 mxn/sample / LECO: $350 due to the volume.

Plant size distribution in this 120 plants? More bigger plants might be more useful. Looking forward to discuss?

- Should be same sample size for each group

- Put in the agreement that if we change anything regarding the technical annex, financial adjustment either reimbursement or further compensation (with adequate financial details) would be needed.

Given the data from the initial 15 plant work, could it go down to 1 sample for penca? Lets discuss.

- Keep 3 samples per plant for penca for the 120 plants.

What's the cost for the sugar analysis? 80 mxn

- Will

- Will summarize other campus people, will do chronogram next version of proposal

- Friday 10 am Mexico city time to meet with don Ruben

Would there be a way of doing this without long idle times? Rainy season is coming

- There wouldn't be too much of idle time

Inventory would be taking all potential variables to fit all

- Will talk about vwhicles and trailers for search when we have chronogram

Inventory: I’m a little unclear how this will actually work.Here is my understanding / Grid size would be adapted / Number of agave (huizache & nopal) will be counted in each zone contiguous to an intersection,  diameter x2 and height will be measured for each agave (what will be measured for huizache and nopal?)Agave density will be extrapolated to the entire field area, and specific agave data will be used to compare to the drone imagery (to correct for height, diameter, and detection) 

- Around 20 variables would be taken for Huizache and nopal
-

- Ramon methodology wouldn't involve individual plant characterization, rather a plantation/population level.

- Individual plant detection possible but not characterization

- Could be part of the final product but would require changes

- Will include this in the proposal

- Could output diameter would need calibration

Is there going to be any detection/quantification for nopal/huizache?

- Details will be added

Could Mike and Daniel be trained to participate in the sampling?
