Could we alter the agreement to make this technical annex shareable with confidentiality restrictions?

- Change it in the general agreement

Polygon not definitive, will probably change with information we get while being there
- Not a problem, as long as we define the general site area. He can change the image without the polygon.

Could you list all the allometric sources which are to be used? (we talked about 3 per species) This would help us when describing this research before publications.

- He will list all variables in this proposal.

Only volume estimation? Not measuring?

- Check if it is written if volume is measured with xilomer

We would propose size groups instead of age groups

3 size groups

- Will change to size 

//Will look to include definition of species in the technical proposal

How would cogollo pencas would be selected?

- The outermost penca, the softest innermost penca, an the one in between.

We would like to discuss possibility of taking slices instead of cubes and more subsamples per piña

- Slice and corer pressler were mentioned, if cutting in 4 parts


Why two lab options?

CEBAJ is closer, but it's more expensive. Unknown sample processing?

Cost for OM lap processing is $150 mxn per sample

- Maybe make a comparison for 3 plants between Cristo's method and dumas
- Archive of samples to go back if needed probably with HC new york equipment

- Proposed method is different fromCristo's method, Ramon will send NOM

- 12 samples of piña per plant well understood

- Freezer for all the samples
