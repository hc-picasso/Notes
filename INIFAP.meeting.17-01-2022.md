## Notes Meeting with  Ramon 

- In the case of estimations of mezquite, huizache and nopal there are allometric equations. Generally they use variables which are not ubtainable with drone, like basal diameter.

    - To confirm HC is looking to develop or use equations usable with drones to estimate biomass and carbon.
    - Adapting allometric equations to run with drone derived data might be the way to go
    - How about adapting raw tree data to canopy and height?
        - Basal diameter important variable due to the distinction between shrub or tree nature of mezquite
    - Maybe sentinel radar info (some radar data is 5mx5m) would help to differientate between shrub and tree
    - precision on nopal biomass asked, Michal answered not as much as maguey.
    - HC wants to evaluate the feasability of using drone data to estimate biomass for other species, by obtaining allometric variables like height diameter, etc. 
    - Given this, in the case of nopal and huizache, proposal from ramón: Try to make the estimation by using 3 different allometric ecuations and make comparison with use of the drone. The difference will be evaluated and from there, if uncertainty is high, it would reveal the need to develop a new model, if not, it's good as is.
    - Michael agrees to that idea. But what happens if allometric models don't use variables obtainable from drone? Ramon respond we can destructively measure ~5 plants to check the esimate and modify models with another variable obtainable with the drone like vegetation index. Or making new correlations like nopal requeta size to basal diameter.
    - Measure ~30 plants to construct this new correlations  

    - Ramon: I'd be best if we are considering other species to start with maguey now, and from this build upon.


###  Flights
- Min doable gsd 4 cm eBee 
- HC would be performer higher res ones ones

### Plantation pattern

- San Felipe: Randomly among the nopales, no rows, but spots here and there
- Zamarripa: Some parts are kwnonwn age somo not. Age groups by row, but rows with different ages more of less close to each other
- Keep same sampling pattern (Random)

### To do's

- HC will review the publication proposal and send it ASAP
- HC will review the new,  general agreement sent by Ramón, this is the final version from their side, so he's only waiting our greenlight to send it to the legal people of INIFAP
- HC will clarify on other species interest, in order to clarify and start asap with maguey
